Why I love cybersecurity.

By Daniel Son

Do you know what the bane of my existence is? Mosquitoes. And recently, when the calendar struck July, the mosquitoes began spawning in to ruin my evening run through trails.

It’s my first run back after a break, and I can’t help but notice the buzzing around my ears, that THWACK on your cheek from a bug flying into it. The mosquitoes are the malcicious hackers trying to exploit my bodies resources.

So I’m sick of it. You know what I do? I don’t back down and give up on running. I say bring it on.

So I build a defense.

First, is clothing. I put on long socks, sweatpants, and a hoodie in order to cover myself from head to toe. The only “Achilles heal” being my face and hands. This, is the cybersecurity equivalent of closing off all ports except the necessary ones (like 80 & 443).

Next, I covered myself with bug spray. This, is the equivalent of deterrent security methods in cybersecurity. The bug spray should theoretically do its best to deter the mosquitoes, but if the mosquitoes do choose to press through it, the spray can’t do anything to prevent the onslaught.

The only remaining “open ports” in my network are my face and hands. First, I pull my sleeves down to my fingertips so they’re fully covered. Boom. Only one attack surface left.

What do I do for my face? I start batting at the area around my face, in a windshield wiper sense. My hands are acting as the last line of defense, swatting away anything that managed to get through the preceding layers of security. Like the Avengers defending the city core from Ultron.

So you’re probably wondering, did it work?

Yes. ZERO mosquitoes bites were felt the next day. My three layered defense worked!

1. I covered all parts of my body except the essential ones
2. I covered myself in bug spray to deter attackers
3. My hands swatted away anything near my face

 In cybersecurity terms,
 
1. I minimized the attack surface by closing off all unnecessary ports
2. I put up “DO NOT ENTER” signs around my facility to deter attackers
3. The CISO and security team acted as the final line of defense, neutralizing any threats that got through

And this was all so I could keep enjoying my nature runs. AKA business continuity.

So why do I love cybersecurity?

It’s that amazing feeling of victory when you’ve successfully defended yourself and innocent people from those pesky hackers.
